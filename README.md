The "Guess the Number" game is a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between a specified range (in this case, between 1 and 100), and the player's goal is to guess that number. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too low, too high, or correct.

Here's a breakdown of how the game works in the provided example:

1. The computer generates a random secret number between 1 and 100.
2. The game welcomes the player and prompts them to enter their guess.
3. The player inputs a number.
4. The game checks if the guessed number is equal to the secret number.
   - If it is, the game congratulates the player and ends.
   - If it's too low, the game informs the player and prompts them to try again.
   - If it's too high, the game informs the player and prompts them to try again.
5. Steps 3-4 are repeated until the player correctly guesses the number.
